    <td>In today's lesson we started of looking how to encrypt your password as well as possible and ended up talking about sexting and revenge porn! 
It started with Mr Keen telling us the number of different number combinations we could have in our passwords. Then we started talking about servants which can calculate huge numbers of the top of there head. Whilst Mr Keen was talking about this i noticed someone messing with my computer Mr Keen also noticed and started talking about the rules surrounding what he was doing and then it trailed of into people asking about revenge porn. :( </td>
