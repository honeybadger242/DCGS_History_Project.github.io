    <td>Today i'm not really sure what we did but it was called clash of code. We were in s a supply lesson and all we were asked to do was play a game called clash of code. When I first went on it It said to choose a username then it said to join a clash, I clicked on this and it then i went into some sort of lobby with people from all around the world joining. The tasks were probably to reprogramme or to programme cod, however I didn't understand this and was very confused as to what to to although I perceived and completed a couple of the tasks.</td>
